<p class="title1">HOW THE WORLD TRAVELS</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
TRAVEL IN THE OLDEN DAYS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap2">"C</span>oach, carriage, wheelbarrow, cart":
we have all, most likely, repeated these
words again and again, as we counted the
cherry-stones out of a pie, the petals of a daisy, or
the tufts on a blade of grass, and we have hoped,
as we counted, that Dame Fortune would give
us a coach or a carriage to drive to church in on
our wedding morning.</p>

<p>A cart seemed a very commonplace affair, and
a wheelbarrow was almost too absurd to be possible.
Yet there are countries where people
actually ride in wheelbarrows and in other conveyances
even more quaint and unusual.</p>

<p>It will be interesting, perhaps, to borrow a
magic carpet for a little while, or the cap of
Fortunatus, and travel round the world and back
through the ages of history, so that we may see
the strange vehicles that are in use to-day, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
those in which our ancestors made their journeys
hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>The first conveyances of all, used in far-away
prehistoric days and later still in wild uncivilised
lands, were simply rough sleds on which heavy
loads were dragged. Later, circular slabs of wood
were cut from the trunks of trees to serve as
wheels, and, instead of pulling these primitive
carts themselves, the men trained oxen to do the
work.</p>

<p>As time went on improvements were made,
and we find pictures of chariots on the walls of
the ancient, ruined cities of Egypt and Assyria.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us of the chariots and horsemen
of Pharaoh, who were overwhelmed in the Red
Sea, but more than two hundred years before
that time King Thutmosis of Egypt had a wonderful
war chariot, which, in 1903, was discovered
in his tomb at Thebes. It is now in the museum
at Cairo, and on it are painted pictures of
Thutmosis driving in the chariot, charging his
enemies and shooting arrows at them.</p>

<p>Other nations also used chariots in warfare,
and we read that they carried two men, one being
the driver and the other the warrior. In a close
encounter the soldier alighted and fought on foot.
Some of these chariots were armed with great
hooks or scythes fastened to the wheels. Julius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
CÃ¦sar tells us that when he invaded Britain the
chief, Cassivelaunus, had more than four thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
chariots, and he describes how skilfully they
were handled by their drivers.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"In the most steep and difficult places," he
says, "they could stop their horses at full stretch,
turn them which way they pleased, run along the
pole, rest on the harness, and throw themselves
back into the chariots with incredible dexterity."</p>

<p>In Britain, at that time, there were also conveyances
for travelling, called <i>benna</i>, and also
larger carriages with four wheels, which carried
the wives and children of the warriors and their
baggage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
The Romans themselves used chariots both for
warlike and peaceful purposes, and they were
named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">biga</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triga</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadriga</i>, according to the
number of horses by which they were drawn.
Chariot races were an important feature of the
great festivals that took place in the Colosseum,
and it is said that Nero once drove one with ten
horses abreast.</p>

<p>These racing chariots were, of course, lightly
made and designed for speed, but there were
other vehicles of great size and magnificence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
which carried successful generals when they rode
in triumph through Rome to celebrate their
victories. This triumphal car was usually drawn
by four white horses, but very often by lions,
elephants, tigers, bears, leopards, or dogs.</p>

<p>Other vehicles for more everyday use were to
be seen in the streets of ancient cities, and in the
paved roadways of Pompeii are deep ruts made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
by the wheels of chariots nearly two thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>ROMAN LITTER AND MOUNTING STOOL.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Litters were also used at that time, and Pliny
calls them "travellers' chambers." They were
borne on shafts, and special slaves used to act as
bearers. Roman ladies often travelled in covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
carriages called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carpenta</i>, which were gorgeously
decorated.</p>

<p>During the mediÃ¦val ages carriages fell into
disuse, or were only employed by women and
invalids, or by kings and princes on ceremonial
occasions. Charlemagne had a wonderful vehicle
with richly ornamented wheels and an inlaid roof
supported by columns, and the Crusaders on their
march had with them large wagons for their
baggage.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century new conveyances
called <i>whirlicotes</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charettes</i> were used. When
King Richard II. married Anne of Denmark,
the new queen entered London accompanied by
her maids of honour, who drove in charettes, which
were wagons with benches, painted red and lined
with scarlet cloth. On London Bridge were
crowds of people anxious to see the royal bride.
In the confusion, one of the charettes was overturned
and the ladies thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>Litters very much like those of Roman days
were still to be seen in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. At her coronation Queen Elizabeth
of York, dressed in white and with her golden
hair loose over her shoulders, was carried through
London in a rich litter, with a canopy over her
head borne by four Knights of the Bath.</p>

<p>Anne Boleyn, in 1553, was carried to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
coronation in a litter covered with cloth of gold,
and the two horses that supported it were clothed
in white damask.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
During the Middle Ages vehicles were so few
because the roads were very bad, and in many
places there were only rough bridle-paths from
one town to another. Riding was, therefore, the
principal means of transit, and horses, mules, and
donkeys were used. Very large horses, the
ancestors of our present cart-horses, were ridden
by the knights, for a warrior in heavy mail could
only be carried by a strong animal. This was
especially the case when it was necessary for the
horse itself to be also clothed in metal armour.</p>

<p>The ladies also rode, and side-saddles were first
introduced into England by Anne of Bohemia,
the wife of Richard II. These saddles were very
different from those of the present day, for they
were like chairs placed sideways on the horses'
backs.</p>

<p>Pack-horses were much used in mediÃ¦val
times, and pictures show us long trains of these
animals, each with its heavy load, wending their
way along the rough, narrow pathways of old
England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
COACHING DAYS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>oaching days! The words carry us
back a hundred years or more, and bring
to our minds gay, romantic pictures of
scarlet-clad postilions, prancing horses, and a
rosy-faced driver with his long whip and quaint
three-tiered cape. We seem to hear the merry
sound of the horns, the ring of hoofs, and the
rattle of harness, as the coach, with its passengers
and piled baggage, clatters along a broad high
road or draws up at the open door of some old-fashioned
English inn. Those are the eighteenth-century
days that we call to mind, the days when
coaching was at its height, but we must go further
back than that if we want to find the origin of this
form of conveyance, and to see how it developed
out of the clumsy wagons and quaint whirlicotes
and charettes of mediÃ¦val times.</p>

<p>We first hear of coaches in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, and they are said to have been introduced
into England in 1594 by a coachman who
was a native of Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
There is an old picture of the great queen
riding in one of her new equipages on some state
occasion. It was open at the sides, had a high
roof decorated with waving plumes, and was
drawn by two richly caparisoned horses.</p>

<div><a name="a_medaeval_coach" id="a_medaeval_coach"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A MEDIÃ†VAL COACH.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At first, it appears, coaches were reserved for
the use of royalty, but Stowe tells us that "after
a while divers great ladies made them coaches
and rid in them up and down the country, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
great admiration of all beholders." He goes on
to say that within twenty years coach-making
became an important trade in England.</p>

<div><a name="an_old_family_coach" id="an_old_family_coach"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>AN OLD FAMILY COACH.</p>
</div></div>

<p>These coaches were very different from those
of later times, for they were open at the sides
and the wheels were very small and low. In
shape they were not unlike the state coach that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
is still used at coronations and other great
occasions.</p>

<div><a name="riding_pillion_fashion" id="riding_pillion_fashion"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>RIDING PILLION FASHION.</p>
</div></div>

<p>During the seventeenth century many alterations
and improvements took place in coach-building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
both in England and France, and in
1620 we find Louis XIV. driving in a carriage
with glass sides. In the reign of this monarch,
too, a curious light two-wheeled conveyance was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
introduced. It was called a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flignette</i> and very
much resembled a modern dog-cart.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>SEDAN CHAIR.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the eighteenth century greater progress was
made as roads improved. Sedan chairs came into
use, and ladies rode pillion fashion, sitting on a
cushion behind the saddle of the horseman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>POST-CHAISE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Hired carriages, too, began to be seen in the
streets of Paris, and in 1625 they appeared in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
London. Very few of them were allowed at first,
but in 1634 an old sea-captain named Baily established
a stand for hackney coaches near the Maypole
in the Strand, and by the end of the century
there were no fewer than eight hundred of these
vehicles in the City and suburbs.</p>

<div><a name="in_the_wild_west" id="in_the_wild_west"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>IN THE WILD WEST.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stage coaches to carry both passengers and
mails were the next innovation, and they were
soon running regularly during summer on three
of the principal high roads of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Nowadays, when we can travel from one end
of the country to the other in a few hours, we
should think the old conveyances very slow
coaches indeed, but at the end of the seventeenth
and during the eighteenth centuries they were
thought marvels of swiftness. It took a week&mdash;only
a week, people said then&mdash;to go from
London to York, and the journey to Manchester
could actually be made in four days.</p>

<p>In Hogarth's pictures we can see what an early
stage coach was like, with its large, clumsy
wheels, high roof, and an enormous basket at the
back in which baggage was carried and where
passengers who wished to travel cheaply could
sit. Later on this basket developed into an extra
back seat, and in a picture painted in 1834 there
is a coach with no less than three separate compartments,
besides having seats on the roof.</p>

<p>In 1784 sixteen coaches left London every day,
and it was one of the sights of the City to see
them start from the General Post Office on their
journeys. Each vehicle had an armed guard,
for those were the days of highwaymen, and it
was no uncommon thing for travellers to be
stopped and robbed by gentlemen of the road.</p>

<p>Dick Turpin was one of these thieves, and for
a long time he terrorised Epping Forest and the
outskirts of London, and another famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;robber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
was the young Frenchman
Claud Duval, about whom many romantic tales
are told. On one occasion he returned the jewels
that he had stolen from a beautiful lady, on condition
that she would descend from her carriage
and dance a measure with him on the open road.</p>

<p>It is difficult now to realise what our highways
were like a hundred years ago and more, when
coaching was at its height. Then the great roads
were crowded with traffic, post-chaises, stage
wagons, and pack-horses. Now it is sad to see
the same roads narrowed to half their former
width by broad borders of grass that have been
allowed to grow.</p>

<p>In those days there were many private travelling
carriages besides the public coaches. A most
interesting one is now in London at Madame
Tussaud's. This is the wonderful coach which
belonged to Napoleon Buonaparte. In it the
great emperor rode back from Russia after the
burning of Moscow, and later on from Cannes
to Paris on his triumphal progress through
France in 1815.</p>

<p>It is said that Napoleon himself designed the
fittings of this carriage, for it contained everything
necessary for a long journey, and was intended
to serve the purpose of a bedroom, a
dining-room, and a kitchen. The coach was captured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
by a German officer after the Battle of
Waterloo, the emperor making his escape on
horseback; and having been purchased by a man
named Bullock, it was exhibited through the
whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Gradually, as time went on, railways superseded
the picturesque old coaches. They continued
to be used, however, in less civilised
countries, and can still be seen in the wild forest
districts of Australia, New Zealand, and America.</p>

<p>In the early pioneer days of the United States
these coaches, with their loads of passengers and
mails, sometimes encountered bands of Red
Indians in their journeys across the prairies, and
there are stories of terrible disasters and narrow
escapes when the travellers were pursued and
attacked by the savages.</p>

<p>Those exciting times have passed away now,
but coaches have not entirely disappeared. In
Hyde Park on Sunday mornings before the War
we could see the beautiful vehicles of the Four-in-hand
Club to remind us of how our great-grandfathers
and great-grandmothers travelled
in the merry&mdash;but, perhaps, rather dangerous&mdash;days
of old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
STRANGE VEHICLES OF EUROPE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is not only in the far-away countries of the
world that we must travel in order to discover
curious conveyances. Some are to be seen
quite near at home, even in England itself. We
must remember that as a rule it is because things
are unfamiliar that they seem quaint and curious,
so let us try to imagine for a few moments that
we are natives of some distant land who have
come to pay a visit to Great Britain.</p>

<p>We land at Dover, perhaps, or Newhaven, and
go along the coast until we come to Brighton.
It is quite a commonplace seaside town, no doubt,
but, in our characters of observant foreigners, we
shall notice many interesting things, and among
them are several extraordinary little vehicles
which are drawn up in a row along the parade.</p>

<p>What can they be, these tiny carriages, each
with its wheels, shafts, and box-seat complete?
Then we see that instead of a pony or donkey,
the little conveyances are drawn by shaggy, long-horned
goats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<div><a name="seaside_carriage_drawn_by_goat" id="seaside_carriage_drawn_by_goat"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>SEASIDE CARRIAGE DRAWN BY GOAT.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
The stranger stares with amusement at the
dainty goat-chaises as they drive away filled with
merry loads of children. Then he travels up to
London and goes for a stroll in one of the poorer
districts of the great city.</p>

<p>It is a Bank Holiday perhaps, or a fine Saturday
in the summer-time, and the costermongers
are off in their donkey-carts for a day's outing on
Hampstead Heath. What a noise and clatter
there is as the heavily laden little vehicles trot
past, the donkeys looking so smart with their
well-groomed coats and bright harness, and the
drivers in the festive costumes decorated with
pearl buttons that, surely, no foreign city in the
world can rival!</p>

<p>We leave Whitechapel or the Old Kent Road
behind us now, and journey out into the country,
where, in some narrow green lane or on a breezy
common, we overtake a yellow-painted gipsy van,
hung about with baskets and brooms, and drawn
by a sturdy, sleepy old horse. The owner of the
van walks at his horse's head, or sits comfortably
on the shaft, and through a little muslin-curtained
window we catch a glimpse of his wife's dark face
and long earrings. The gipsy children, ragged,
bright-eyed urchins, lag behind, gathering
flowers from the hedges, or run through the dust
of the road to beg for pennies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Certainly England has its own share of strange
vehicles, and there are others even more curious
still to be seen in out-of-the-way districts. One
of these is the two-wheeled cart used for farm-work
in some parts of Wales, which, in shape, is
almost exactly like the ancient chariots that were
found in Britain by the Roman invaders when
they landed between Walmer and Sandwich
nearly two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Across St. George's Channel the quaint-looking
Irish jaunting car is to be found, and then
we travel back again to the continent of Europe.
If we landed at Ostend or Antwerp before the
War, most likely the first thing we should have
seen would be a neat little cart loaded with
vegetables or bright milk-cans, and harnessed to
one or two large handsome dogs.</p>

<p>In England most dogs, except those owned by
farmers or sportsmen, lead idle lives, but this is
not the case on the Continent. The dogs of
Belgium, Holland, and Germany are quite content
to work&mdash;and to work hard, too&mdash;for their
livings. There are numbers of them in the towns
and villages, bravely dragging heavy loads, or
lying down between the shafts and taking a well-earned
nap in some shady corner of the cobbled
street.</p>

<div><a name="belgian_dog_drawn_cart" id="belgian_dog_drawn_cart"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>BELGIAN DOG-DRAWN CART.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Belgium dogs were employed, not only for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
peaceful purposes, but in times of war for drawing
ambulances, little ammunition wagons, and
machine-guns.</p>

<p>Oxen are also used to draw carts in most of the
European countries, and very picturesque some
of them are. In Turkey most elaborate bullock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
carts are used in some districts as mourning carriages,
and in them women are conveyed when
they wish to visit the grave-yards. These carts
are usually drawn by two animals which wear,
fixed to their collars, large curved pieces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
wood hung with tassels. The carts themselves
are elaborately decorated, and while one man
leads the bullocks another, staff in hand, walks
at the side of the vehicle.</p>

<div><a name="turkish_mourning_cart" id="turkish_mourning_cart"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>TURKISH MOURNING CAR.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are many other strange conveyances to
be seen in Turkey, perhaps the most curious of
all being the sedan chairs which, although they
have quite disappeared from other cities of
Europe, are still used at night or on snowy days
in the streets of Constantinople. In the
eighteenth century sedan chairs were common
in England, and in them the powdered and
patched ladies went to their balls and routs, but
it is strange to think of the quaint old-world
conveyances being carried by stalwart Turkish
porters along the dark, muddy streets of an
Oriental city. These chairs, like the agricultural
carts of Wales, come down to us from a
past age, and another strange survival is seen at
Schiessel, a village near Bremen, where the
peasant girls drive to weddings and other festivities
in large wagons that, painted and decorated
with garlands of flowers, are exactly like the old
carts and charettes of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Russia is a country where the carriages appear
very strange to English eyes, for there three
horses are driven abreast, and while the two outer
animals gallop, the one in the centre is trained to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
trot. As may be imagined, a very skilful and
experienced driver is necessary to guide these
droskeys, as they are called, along the rough
country roads or through the crowded streets of
a city.</p>

<p>Among other curious vehicles which may be
seen in Europe are the small two-wheeled omnibuses
of Portugal and the quaint, gaily-decorated
carts of Sicily. These latter conveyances are
picturesque and interesting, for they are covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
with paintings of figures and landscapes, while
even the wheels are ornamented and carved.
Donkeys draw these brilliant little carts, and they
are usually used by fruit-sellers, but often they
may be seen with a heavy load of passengers.</p>

<p>Before the time of railways large public travelling
carriages, called diligences, were used in
France, Switzerland, and other European countries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
They were great, cumbrous vehicles
carrying many passengers with their luggage.
In out-of-the-way country districts, and among
the mountains, these old-fashioned diligences are
still to be seen, clattering along the dusty roads
or toiling up the steep passes across the Alps.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
JOURNEYS THROUGH INDIA</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap1">W</span>e have seen some of the strange vehicles
of England and Europe, and now we
will travel eastward into Asia. There,
as is only right, we must go first to India, for the
great peninsula is one of King George's dominions,
and its inhabitants, whether they be black,
brown, or yellow, Hindoo or Mahomedan,
civilised or savage, are as much British subjects
as we are ourselves.</p>

<p>India is an immense country, extending as it
does from the Himalayas in the north to Point
de Galle in the extreme south of Ceylon, and if
we travel through the country we shall find many
curious vehicles. Some of them are exactly the
same as those which were in use hundreds of
years ago, for India is a conservative land, and,
although there are railways and tramways there
now, while fine motor-cars speed along the roads,
most of the natives are content with old ways,
and travel through the country districts in the

quaint bullock carts and palanquins that satisfied
their ancestors in the days before the powers of
steam and electricity had been discovered.</p>

<p>CART IN COLOMBO, CEYLON.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We will begin with Colombo, as that is usually
the place where travellers land on their journey
to the East. When we go ashore from our
steamer we either take rickshaws, which were
introduced into the island from Japan in 1883,
or else engage one of the little bullock carts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
drive through the picturesque, tree-shaded streets
of the town. These bullock carts, or gharis,
have two wheels and can be driven very quickly.
They are provided with hoods, as the sun is very
hot in tropical Ceylon.</p>

<p>The bullocks are often decorated with elaborate
patterns cut or branded into their hides, and the
natives excuse this cruel practice by saying that
not only does it distinguish the animals from each
other and prevent their being stolen, but that it
also protects them from rheumatism.</p>

<p>There are many larger carts with quaint, palm-thatched
roofs to be seen in Colombo. These
are called hackeries and are found in many parts
of India. It is often strange and amusing to see
the numbers of natives, men, women, and children,
who are able to pack themselves into one of
these vehicles.</p>

<p>There are a great many different varieties of
bullock carts in India. Those in Coonoor, for
instance, have very high, narrow hoods, while in
Bombay an awning is provided which stretches
out over the bullock's back and shelters both
passengers and driver. Another type of cart
has four wheels and curious cage-like sides, while
the wooden cover is provided with blinds and
there is a rack for baggage on the roof.</p>

<p>In Madras the raikla, a vehicle of quite a different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
description, is seen. It appears to consist
merely of two wheels and a tiny seat for the
driver. These carts are very swift, and are used
when great speed is required.</p>

<p>In Ajmere the bullock carts have awnings supported
by four poles, and in Calcutta there are
elaborately decorated carriages drawn by gaily
caparisoned oxen.</p>

<p>Other interesting conveyances are those in
which the zenana ladies travel. These are carts
with a hood, and velvet curtains at the sides.
When in use the curtains can be tightly drawn,
so that passers-by cannot catch a glimpse of the
passengers.</p>

travellers.</p>

In some districts of India camels draw carriages,
and we have a picture of a brougham into
which two of these ungainly animals are harnessed.
Very strange it looks, with the drivers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
seated on the humps of the camels and a rather
unnecessary coachman perched on the box-seat
of the vehicle. A more imposing equipage is the
state carriage of the Begum of Bhopal, for this
is drawn by four camels, splendidly caparisoned,
and each with a helmeted rider, while other servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
in quaint and gorgeous costumes are in
attendance. The effect is very striking.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>CAMELS HARNESSED TO CARRIAGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Besides these elaborate conveyances there are
several kinds of palanquins for use on rough roads
and in mountainous districts. Palkis are litters
attached to a single long pole which is carried on
the shoulders of two or more men. Dhoolies are
square boxes, rather like sedan chairs, in which
native ladies sometimes travel, and the ruth is a
palanquin on wheels.</p>

<p>In India camels are ridden by both men and
women. The latter often sit in kujawas, which
are small square panniers made of wood and
strong netting, and are hung on either side of
the animal's back.</p>

<p>Horses, bullocks, and donkeys are also ridden,
but the most imposing steed in India is the elephant,
and very magnificent these great animals
look when they are carrying native rajahs or
taking part in some religious procession. On
these occasions the howdah, which is like a palanquin
perched on the elephant's back, is painted
or covered with gold and silver, while the animal
itself is often gaily coloured and has his tusks
decorated with jewels and flowers.</p>

<p>Elephants, however, are not always decked in
this fantastic fashion, and often the howdah is a
very simple affair rather like a huge basket in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
appearance. Sometimes the mahout, as the
keeper of the elephant is called, sits on the
animal's broad neck or rides on a rough wooden
saddle.</p>

<p>One of the most curious conveyances to be seen
in India is a travelling theatre, which consists of
a large, railed platform fastened across the backs
of two elephants which walk side by side. This
strange moving stage figures in wedding processions
and other festivals, and during its passage
through the streets of a town dancing girls give
performances on the platform, which is brightly
illuminated.</p>

<p>Elephants are strange animals and need to be
very carefully trained and kindly treated. There
is a story that once in Ceylon a newly-caught elephant,
when required to draw a wagon, felt this
to be such an indignity that he lay down between
the shafts and died!</p>

<p>Perhaps his relations in India are not quite so
proud and sensitive, for in that country we find
them doing a great deal of hard work. They
move large logs of wood, carry heavy burdens,
and also drag cannon. At times, even, they may
be seen taking the place of steam-engines and
drawing railway trucks along the line. In fact,
there is nothing in the way of hard and heavy
work that the elephant cannot do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
THE CONVEYANCES OF CHINA AND JAPAN</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne is always accustomed to think of China
as a strange, topsy-turvy country, where
everything is marvellous and unexpected,
so that it is no surprise to find there many queer
conveyances and modes of travel. Even in very
early times China, or Tartary as it was called
then, was looked upon as a veritable wonderland,
and Marco Polo, who explored the country more
than six hundred years ago, gives us a very interesting
description of how the Emperor travelled
when he went on one of his hunting expeditions.
This is what he says:</p>

<p>"The Khan upon his journey is borne upon
four elephants, in a fine parlour made of timber,
lined inside with plates of beaten gold and outside
with lions' skins. Sometimes, as they go
along, and the Emperor from his chamber is discoursing
with his nobles, one of the latter will
exclaim, 'Sire! Look out for cranes!' Then the
Emperor has the top of his chamber thrown back,
and having seen the cranes, he casts one of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
falcons, and often the quarry is struck in his sight,
so that he himself has the most exquisite sport as
he sits in his chamber or lies on his bed. I do
not believe that there ever existed a man with
such sport or enjoyment as he has."</p>

<p>Modern tourists in China cannot see quite such
wonderful equipages as this, but the Emperor's
state palanquin, which was still in use in 1880,
was a very gorgeous affair, and it was carried by
no less than sixteen bearers.</p>

<p>China has always been a land of ceremony, and
very strict etiquette is maintained with regard to
the conveyances of the mandarins. Sedan chairs
are used, and these vary in colour, decoration,
and number of carriers, according to the rank of
the owner. If the mandarin is of a very high
class he is accompanied on his journeys by a whole
retinue of servants. One of these carries a large
open umbrella, a second has a fan attached to a
pole, while others bear tablets on which the insignia
of his rank are displayed. It is a great offence
if a man has more coolies in attendance than those
to which he is entitled.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>CHINESE COUNTRY CHAIR.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In a wedding procession a beautiful palanquin
is used to take the bride from her parents' house
to the home of her future husband. It is painted
red and ornamented with kingfishers' feathers.
The little Chinese lady only travels once in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
gorgeous conveyance. After her marriage she
has to be content with an ordinary sedan chair,
the curtains of which are always tightly drawn so
that she can neither see nor be seen as she is carried
through the streets.</p>

<p>When an important mandarin travels everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
makes way for him and his imposing retinue,
but with those of lower rank this is not the case,
and it is one of the duties of his bearers to keep
up a constant succession of loud shouts and commands
such as "Mind your back!" "Move to
the right!" "Get out of the way!" As may be
imagined the streets of a Chinese town are very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
noisy, for they are narrow and crowded with a
motley throng of people, among whom are porters
with heavy packs on their shoulders, itinerant
merchants carrying their wares in baskets slung
on long poles, beggars, and children of all sizes
and ages.</p>

<p>WHEELBARROW OMNIBUS.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Besides these private sedan chairs there are
others which may be hired. These are fairly
comfortable, being provided with cushions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
having a narrow shelf on either side on which the
passenger can rest his arms. In country districts,
however, the traveller has to be content with a
simpler conveyance, consisting of a roughly made
bamboo chair attached to long poles.</p>

<div><a name="a_travelling_tradesman" id="a_travelling_tradesman"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A TRAVELLING TRADESMAN.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes much larger palanquins are seen.
These will hold several people and are carried by
two mules or ponies.</p>

<p>In China, rickshaws, which are wheeled chairs
drawn by one or more coolies, are also used, their
name coming from the Chinese word <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">jin-li-che</i>,
which means "man-power-carriage." These little
vehicles are convenient, but in many cities the
streets are so narrow that they cannot be employed.
Then it is that we find the quaint wheelbarrows,
which are, perhaps, the strangest conveyances
in the whole world. These wheelbarrows
are used both to carry passengers and
merchandise. Those intended for the former
purpose have a very large wheel, on either side of
which is a seat arranged rather in the fashion of
an Irish jaunting car. Below the seat a cord is
suspended on which the feet of the travellers can
rest. Two, four, six, or even, sometimes, as
many as eight native women can be carried, and
the coolie who pushes the barrow has a strap
across his shoulders which eases his arms of some
of the weight. Occasionally hooded wheelbarrows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
are seen, and for them a second coolie in front is
employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>CHINESE CART.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Northern China donkeys and bullocks often
drag these strange, one-wheeled carts. The
roads are so bad that it is almost impossible for
larger vehicles to be used, although sometimes
we see a native family with their household goods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
moving from one place to another in a rough
wagon drawn by an ox and a donkey harnessed
side by side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>JAPANESE RICKSHAW.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From China we travel still further east, and in
Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun, other curious
and picturesque conveyances are to be seen by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
fortunate tourist who is able to journey so far
afield.</p>

<p>Horses are very little used in this country, and
the Chinese jin-li-che is the principal conveyance,
its name being now changed into jin-ri-che or
jinricksha. Very charming these little vehicles
look, as they careen through the streets of a town,
or under the blossom-covered cherry-trees of a
country road, especially if the wheels are painted
scarlet, and if the passengers are two dainty little
Jap maidens, with gay obis round their waists and
flowers decking their smooth, dark heads.</p>

<p>The coolies who draw the jinrickshas are also
picturesque in their blue cotton clothes, and in
winter-time they wear most extraordinary straw
cloaks which make them look like small moving
haystacks.</p>

<p>Another interesting Japanese conveyance is
the kago. This is a small, hammock-shaped litter
made of cane and bamboo, suspended to a strong
pole. There is an awning overhead, and on this
the light luggage of the passenger&mdash;a pair of
straw shoes, a bouquet of chrysanthemums, or a
bundle tied up in a brightly coloured handkerchief&mdash;is
carried.</p>

<p>The bearers of a kago are two stalwart, bare-legged
men, and they always carry long sticks in
their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
This curious type of litter is much used by the
Japanese themselves, but not by Europeans, as
the occupant of a kago has to sit with his knees
doubled up in what seems to Western ideas a
most uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>There are other strange conveyances to be
seen in Japan, one of the most interesting of all
being the Imperial chariot which has its place in
great religious processions. It is drawn by a
black bull, and is decorated with the Mikado's
crest, a sixteen-petalled chrysanthemum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
JOURNEYS THROUGH AFRICA</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap2">"F</span>rom the Cape to Cairo." We have all
heard of the wonderful railway which
some day is to run all the way from Table
Bay to Egypt, and is to carry passengers in ease
and luxury through the heart of Darkest Africa.
That will be in the future, no doubt; but, even if
the railway were already finished, it would surely
be more interesting to travel in the old-fashioned
ways, and, even if it necessitated hardships and
fatigue, see something of the great continent and
of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, then, that we start on our
journey from Cape Town, and, ignoring the railway
which already could carry us far into Central
Africa, put the clock back for fifty years, or more,
and engage one of the great bullock wagons in
which the old colonists made their adventurous
pilgrimages.</p>

<p>A traveller who journeyed through South
Africa in 1846 gives an interesting account of his
conveyance and experiences.</p>

<div><a name="cape_bullock_wagon" id="cape_bullock_wagon"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>CAPE BULLOCK WAGON.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
"In travelling by wagon one gets along
slowly," he says. "Twenty miles a day is
reckoned moderate, and two and a half miles an
hour is the usual rate of progress. Cooking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
utensils, as a kettle, a gridiron, and a pot, accompany
the wagon. Bedding is also a part of the
travelling appurtenances, and is either made up
at night in the body of the wagon or in the open
country, according to the weather."</p>

<p>This description sounds pleasant and comfortable
enough, but the men and women who in
those days set out across unexplored country in
search of new homes often had to endure hardships
and face terrible dangers, for the Kaffirs and
Zulus were fierce and warlike, and they often
attacked and murdered the newcomers.</p>

<p>As a safeguard against these enemies the
colonists used to arrange their wagons at night in
a circle, and within the primitive fort, or laager as
it was called, they would make their camp and
light watch-fires to frighten away lions and other
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>South African wagons are very large and have
canvas hoods. Whole families can travel in them
comfortably, and sometimes as many as sixteen
oxen are used.</p>

<p>North of Cape Colony is Natal, the oldest of
the British possessions in South Africa, and now
we will leave our quaint, old-world wagon and
pay a visit to the port of Durban as it is to-day.</p>

<div><a name="durban_rickshaw" id="durban_rickshaw"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>DURBAN RICKSHAW.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here we shall see careering along the streets or
waiting to be hired, some very strange little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
vehicles indeed, and shall hardly recognise them
at first as our old friends the rickshaws of Japan
and Ceylon. When we look more closely, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
we shall see that the rickshaws themselves
are just the same as those which speed along the
red roads of Colombo or under the cherry blossoms
of Yokohama.</p>

<p>It is the men who drag them that are extraordinary,
for the Kaffir rickshaw boys of Durban
wear the most amazing costumes and deck themselves
out in queer finery of all sorts. Beads,
scraps of ribbon, feathers, all these are pressed
into the service, and very often as a finishing touch
of grandeur the boys fasten buffalo horns on to
their woolly heads.</p>

<p>Leaving Natal behind us, we will go up country
beyond the reach of railway lines. There travellers
have to make their journeys in Cape carts,
which are two-wheeled vehicles drawn by a pair
of mules and driven by a Basuto. These natives
are among the finest drivers in the whole world,
and they will whip up their mules and dash recklessly
up hill and down dale, no matter how rough
the road may be, or even, as often happens, if
there is no road at all.</p>

<p>There is no brake to a Cape cart, and the
harness is frequently rotten or mended with scraps
of string or tape, but nothing seems to matter,
and the Basuto will generally manage to bring
his passengers and the piles of baggage safely to
their destinations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Occasionally in these districts a more ambitious
conveyance is provided, this being a coach, much
like the old stage coaches of England in appearance,
drawn by ten mules instead of four smart,
prancing horses.</p>

<p>Further north we notice many strange modes
of travel, such as a white man riding a bullock
with saddle, harness, and stirrups complete; or a
Masai family on the move, the woman leading an
ox which carries not only her husband but all the
household goods and chattels.</p>

<p>At Beira we reach the boundaries of civilisation
again, for here a little tramcar may be seen running
through the streets. It is, however, rather
a primitive affair and consists only of a light car
or trolly, on which is room for one passenger, the
whole being pushed along by a scantily dressed
native.</p>

<p>We travel on northward again and reach Khartum,
whence a finished section of the Cape to
Cairo railway will carry us to Wadi Halfa. Here,
as throughout Egypt, donkeys are an important
means of transport, and very smart the little
animals look with their red leather, humped
saddles, large stirrups, and the blue bead necklaces
which are worn to protect them from the
Evil Eye. The poorer inhabitants of Egypt and
the Sudan have to be content with more simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
attired mounts, and they either use a rough pad
as a saddle or else ride bare-back.</p>

<p>In Cairo, the old capital of Egypt, we find
vehicles of all descriptions, for this city is a strange
mixture of East and West. In the crowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
streets motor-cars and buffaloes, splendid private
carriages and long strings of clover-laden camels
jostle each other, while steam tramcars carry
tourists to the Pyramids and old Arabs on their
tiny donkeys jog contentedly along the road in
front of the great European hotels.</p>

<div><a name="cairo_cart" id="cairo_cart"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>CAIRO CART.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The equipage of a rich Egyptian or high official
is an imposing sight in the streets of Cairo. It is
preceded by two or more gaily clad servants, or
saises, who run in front of the horses with long
sticks in their hands and shout to the pedestrians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and the more humble conveyances to get out of
the way.</p>

<p>Among these latter, which halt and draw back
against the wall at the sais's command, we see
some of the most curious of all the vehicles of
Egypt, the little flat, two-wheeled carts on which
native women of the poorer classes are conveyed.
These carts are drawn by a mule or donkey, led
by an Arab, and each carries a group of crouching
women, who sit closely together with their black
veils drawn over their faces. "An Arab taking
out his wives for an airing"&mdash;that is how tourists
often describe these quaint vehicles, but really
they are public conveyances, and the native
women, having paid their fares, are going on
shopping expeditions to the bazaars or to visit
their friends in some distant part of the city.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, these picturesque conveyances
are beginning to be considered old-fashioned,
and the natives crowd into the electric
trams which run in all directions through the
town and into the suburbs beyond.</p>

<p>Alexandria is even more up-to-date than Cairo,
for there not only tramcars but motor-omnibuses
are to be seen.</p>

<p>Morocco, another country of North Africa,
although much nearer to Europe, is still very
much behind the times, and therefore even more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
interesting, perhaps, than Algeria and Egypt.
In Tangier, for instance, the streets are so steep
and rough that only very primitive vehicles can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
used, and most people, natives and Europeans
alike, ride either on donkeys, mules, or ponies.</p>

<p>IN MOROCCO.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The SÃ´k, or market-place, in this city is most
picturesque, for there can be seen groups of pack-mules,
laden and ready to start off on some long
journey; ponies with women sitting on strange
saddles set sideways like chairs, and Arab chiefs
mounted on their magnificent horses. The
market-place itself is very curious, with its whitewashed
and narrow gateways, through which the
mules with their large panniers can scarcely pass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
JOURNEYS IN THE NEW WORLD</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the Old World we go to the New, and
see if we can find any curious vehicles in the
great continents of America and Australia.</p>

<p>Beginning with America, as that was the first
of the new lands to be discovered, we will go back
to the days when Red Indians lived in the forests
and rode their wild, hardy ponies across the
prairies. The Indians had no wheeled conveyances,
but they harnessed their ponies to strange
little sleds, which dragged on the ground and supported
the long tent poles and heavy loads of
household gear.</p>

<p>These Red Indians were very brave but savage
and treacherous, and they bitterly resented the
coming of strangers into their land.</p>

<p>The early settlers lived in constant dread of
attack and massacre, and they were always armed
when they cultivated their clearings in the forests
or ventured further and further afield into the undiscovered
country of the West.</p>

<p>The conveyances used by the colonists of North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
America were large, hooded wagons, very much
like those to be seen in Africa, and in these prairie
schooners, as they were sometimes called, the
pioneers carried their wives and their children out
into the wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>AMERICAN TROTTER.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The wagons were drawn by teams of strong
horses, mules, or oxen, and large numbers of
emigrants generally travelled together. This was
necessary, as small parties would almost certainly
have been attacked by the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Even when they did travel in company the
colonists were not always safe, and a man who
went to the West in 1850 tells a terrible story of
his adventures.</p>

<div><a name="quebec_caleche" id="quebec_caleche"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>QUEBEC CALÃˆCHE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On this occasion Indian guides were employed
to lead the way across the passes of the Rocky
Mountains, and these guides proved to be untrustworthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and treacherous. One night, when the
camp was pitched in a forest, nearly all the horses
were stolen, together with the stores, and then,
when the emigrants were in this helpless position,
they were attacked by a band of Indians. After
that, the story seems like one of the cinema plays
with which nowadays we are all familiar, for the
writer tells how he and another man were chosen
to ride for help to a neighbouring fort, how they
were pursued by the savages, how they escaped,
and how, finally, when they returned, it was to
find that they were too late, and that during their
absence the wagons had been burnt and the hapless
people murdered.</p>

<p>Even disasters like this did not, however, daunt
the brave adventurers, and thirteen years later we
hear of a huge convoy starting westward from
Chicago. On this occasion many, who could not
afford to purchase wagons, set out on foot for the
long journey of more than a thousand miles, dragging
their possessions on little two-wheeled handcarts.</p>

<p>Times have changed now, and there are many
railways crossing the great continent. The
Indians have disappeared from the forests, and
in the Rocky Mountains gay parties of holidaymakers
can be seen in the summer-time, riding in
the same woods where, a century ago, their ancestors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
grimly alert and with guns in their hands
toiled along on the weary journey that was to
bring them at last to the wonderful "El Dorado"
of their dreams, where new homes and fabulous
riches were to be found.</p>

<p>At the present time in the western districts the
men are great riders, and extraordinary feats of
horsemanship are common among the cowboys on
some of the cattle ranches.</p>

<p>The vehicles of modern North America are
much like those of European countries, but mention
must be made of the curious cars used to show
off the paces of the celebrated trotting horses.
These little two-wheeled carts are very lightly
made, and seem to consist merely of two wheels,
a small seat, and a pair of shafts.</p>

<p>In Quebec, Canada, a very smart cab may be
seen. It is of picturesque appearance, on two
high wheels, and bears the French name of
"calÃ¨che."</p>

<p>In South America there are not many curious
vehicles. A great part of the country is covered
with tropical forests, and in the south riding is the
principal means of getting from place to place.
Mules and oxen are used as beasts of burden, and
in some districts quaint-looking animals called
llamas are also employed. These creatures,
which most of us have seen in zoological gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
are very hardy and can carry heavy loads on their
backs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>LLAMAS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Not far from the coast of America is Cuba, and
here bullock wagons suitable to the tropical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
climate of the island are used, with shady roofs
made of palm-leaves. These are driven by
negroes, who urge on the animals with long, iron-pointed
goads. The reins are attached to the
ends of the bullock's horns.</p>

<div><a name="cuban_volante" id="cuban_volante"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>CUBAN VOLANTE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the streets of Havana, the capital of Cuba,
hooded carriages called volantes, or kitrins, are
seen. They are drawn by two horses or mules,
one being harnessed between the shafts while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
other is outside on the left. Sometimes three
horses are driven abreast. These vehicles are
very curious in appearance, for they have enormous
wheels and shafts that are over fifteen feet
in length. The horses are ridden by negro postilions,
who sometimes wear gorgeous scarlet
liveries ornamented with gold lace, and jack-boots
that reach almost to their waists.</p>

<p>From Cuba we can travel east or west, sailing
either round the Horn or the Cape of Good Hope,
but whichever direction we choose our ship comes
at last to the great island continent of Australia.
There we find, in the large towns such as Sydney
and Melbourne, tramways, motor-cars, and even
the old familiar hansom cabs of the London
streets.</p>

<p>Australia has not any strange vehicles of its
own, for when discovered it was inhabited only by
savages, and it had no animals that could be used
as beasts of burden. These latter have, however,
been imported and acclimatized, and now horses
and cattle may be seen everywhere, while, if we
travel across the sandy plains of the west, we meet
long lines of heavily laden camels that look as if
they had marched straight out of the Sahara or
the Arabian deserts.</p>

<p>The horses of Australia are now famous all over
the world, and the Colonial riders are as celebrated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Indeed, in many districts men almost
live in the saddle, for in the great southern continent
estates are measured not by acres but by
hundreds of miles, and the shepherds and boundary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>

<p>An Australian horseman "up country" is a
very picturesque figure with his slouched felt hat,

<p>There are not, as yet, many railways in the
more thinly inhabited districts of Australia, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
travellers drive in coaches drawn by two or four
horses. Other vehicles are the buggies, light two-wheeled
conveyances which can be used where
there are few roads and the tracks through the
bush are rough and steep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
TRAVELLING IN THE WILDS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter seeing the strange conveyances and
modes of travel in Europe and in the civilised
countries of Asia, it will be interesting
to leave the beaten tracks behind us altogether
for a time. We will go beyond the high roads
and the railways, and find out how people make
journeys in the great wildernesses of the world,
where travellers must be prepared to undergo discomforts
and hardships, to meet with dangers,
and, very often, to carry their lives in their hands.</p>

<p>If we open our atlases and turn to the maps of
Africa, America, Asia, and Australia, we shall
find that in each continent there are blank
spaces. Sometimes these are called deserts or
forests, but often we can only guess at the character
of the country from the fact of there being
no rivers marked and very few names of towns
and cities.</p>

<p>The most famous of all deserts is the Great
Sahara, which extends for thousands of miles
across the north of Africa. Most people picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
it as a huge sandy plain, where there is no water
and no sign of life or vegetation; but, in reality,
although there are districts where the shifting
sandhills stretch away as far as the eye can see, a
vast part of the Sahara consists of a stony tableland
covered with a scanty growth of low, thorny
bushes.</p>

<p>In the deserts there are, moreover, many fertile
spots looking like exquisite little green islands
set in the midst of a glowing, yellow sea. They
are called oases, and are found where there are
wells or pools of water. Arabs live in these
places, cultivating the land and building mud-houses,
while other tribes spend their time in
wandering about the desert, seeking food for their
animals and trading in the scattered towns and
villages. These wanderers, or nomads, with their
camels, horses, and herds of sheep and goats, may
be seen slowly moving across the great sunburnt
plain and pitching their brown tents at night
among the sand-dunes.</p>

<div><a name="mixed_transport_in_nigeria" id="mixed_transport_in_nigeria"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>MIXED TRANSPORT IN NIGERIA.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The nomadic Arabs travel in large parties called
caravans, for there are brigands in the Sahara
who would rob and murder lonely wayfarers.
The men in the caravan often ride, and their
horses are considered the finest in the whole
world. The Arabs prize these horses highly and
treat them well, never allowing them to be teased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
by the children, and, at the end of a long day's
journey, giving them their meal of milk and dates
before they eat anything themselves.</p>

<p>Horses, however, are only used for riding, and
all the hard work is done by the camels, "the
ships of the desert," as they are called. It is a
strange sight to see a great caravan crossing the
desert, sometimes as many as a thousand camels
marching along in single file, each with a heavy
load on his back.</p>

<p>Camels are strange animals, for although they
are strong and have wonderful powers of endurance,
they are surly, intractable, and even more
obstinate than mules. Occasionally a camel will
consider that he is overloaded, and lying down will
snarl at his driver and refuse to move. Blows
and commands are useless in such a case, but if the
driver pretends to remove something from the
burden the animal is often completely deceived,
and thinking that he has outwitted his master and
gained a victory, will rise to his feet and start off
contentedly on the journey.</p>

<p>One of the greatest dangers of desert travel is
lack of water, for wells are very few and far apart.
Camels are particularly suited to these conditions,
as they can live for several days without drinking,
and when no water is forthcoming, will plod
patiently on and on, until their strength is exhausted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and they fall down beneath their heavy
loads.</p>

<div><a name="camel_with_bridal_bower" id="camel_with_bridal_bower"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>CAMEL WITH BRIDAL BOWER.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It will be noticed in a caravan that some of the
camels carry extraordinary fan-shaped palanquins
on their backs. These contain the Arab ladies,
whose religion obliges them to be veiled, and who
can thus travel securely screened from sight. In
the deserts of Asia the women ride in a much
more airy and comfortable fashion, being provided
with cushioned panniers slung on either side of
the camel's back and sheltered by a light awning.
On the occasion of a wedding in the Nile Delta
district, the bride is carried on a camel in a curious
erection shaped like a Red Indian wigwam and
decorated with a large tuft of palm-leaves.</p>

<p>From the deserts we go to the great tropical
forests, and there, although there is plenty of
water and shelter from the fierce rays of the sun,
travellers have to encounter new difficulties, new
hardships, and new dangers.</p>

<div><a name="carriers_in_the_forest" id="carriers_in_the_forest"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>CARRIERS IN THE FOREST.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Those of us who have seen only woods in our
own islands can hardly imagine what one of the
great forests of Central Africa, America, or Asia
is like, with its huge trees, strange plants, and hot,
steamy atmosphere, dank with the smell of rotting
vegetation and stagnant water, or heavy with the
overpowering fragrance of some tropical blossom.
It is almost dark, for the foliage is dense, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
trees are, moreover, hung with matted curtains
of creepers, while below is a tangled undergrowth,
so tall and thick that pathways have to be cut
through it inch by inch.</p>

<div><a name="palanquin_for_arab_women" id="palanquin_for_arab_women"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Palanquin for Arab Women.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The travellers must needs walk single file
through these narrow tracks, and they must be
always armed and on their guard against the dangerous
wild animals that live in those weird,
gloomy jungles. Leopards, fierce gorillas, and
rhinoceros, all have their homes in those dark
thickets, and there are besides great herds of elephants
that if alarmed will charge through the
forest and trample the intruders underfoot.</p>

<p>In addition to these perils the natives are often
unfriendly, and there have been many instances
of cruelty and murder.</p>

<p>In these districts it is, of course, impossible to
use wagons or any large vehicles, and the climate
is unhealthy for horses and cattle. Negroes,
therefore, act as carriers and march along the
narrow paths with heavy loads on their heads.
These natives are very strong, and may be seen
carrying large bales, boxes, and even bicycles
through the jungle.</p>

<p>The Europeans of the party either walk too,
or are carried in hammocks slung on poles. An
awning is fixed over the hammock, and the occupant
can lie down comfortably while he is borne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
along by two or more negro porters. Wounded
men or those ill with fever are often taken for
many miles in this fashion, and in Nigeria special
hospital hammocks are provided for this purpose
on which the familiar red cross may be seen.</p>

<div><a name="mono_rail_worked_by_natives" id="mono_rail_worked_by_natives"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>MONO-RAIL WORKED BY NATIVES.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The natives of these tropical forests either carry
their merchandise and other burdens themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
or have light conveyances suited to the narrow
tracks that are the only roads of the country. The
Sobo negroes of West Africa have a very
ingenious arrangement, and often three or four
of them may be seen walking in single file and
carrying a long pole on their shoulders. From
this pole are hung jars, bundles, and baskets of
fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>In another district a still more curious device is
used. This is a single railway line running between
two towns, on which light trucks can travel.
These trucks have two wheels each, one behind
the other, and to each truck is fastened a pole
which projects on the left-hand side. Negroes
walk beside the line, holding the poles and thus
driving the cars along.</p>

<p>In regions where the forest is less dense and the
climate more dry and healthy, animals can be
used, and sometimes strange teams are seen&mdash;camels,
donkeys, and oxen being all pressed into
the transport service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
THROUGH ICE AND SNOW</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Arctic regions, far beyond the reach of
railways, and where even the sea is frozen
during many months of the year, we find
strange conveyances and means of travel, for in
those desolate lands there are no roads. Even if
a track is made it may, within a few hours, be
covered with drifting snow and entirely lost.</p>

<p>Horses and oxen cannot live in the bitter
climate of the north, so carriages, or any other
wheeled conveyances, are useless. Travellers,
therefore, must needs adapt themselves to the
conditions of weather and country, and either
invent new means of locomotion or else borrow
ideas from the original inhabitants of those bleak,
snow-clad lands.</p>

<p>The first Arctic explorers described their experiences
in the Polar regions, and life among the
Esquimaux has changed very little since those
pioneer days when Frobisher and Sir Humphrey
Gilbert set sail in search of a new route to India
and the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
"They are a very strong people and warlike,"
the historian of Frobisher's expedition wrote in
1577. "They go in coats made from the skins
of beasts. They travel in sledges drawn by dogs,
and move from place to place in quest of food."</p>

<p>The dogs seen then by the adventurous Englishmen
and still used by the natives are sturdy,
rough-haired animals, rather like large shaggy
collies in appearance. They are very strong and
hardy, and are able to drag heavy loads for long
distances. Esquimaux sledges were often nearly
twelve feet long and had runners made of the jawbones
of whales or of pieces of wood strongly
lashed together.</p>

<div><a name="ice_boat" id="ice_boat"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>ICE-BOAT.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Arctic travellers soon found that if they wished
to journey far into the Polar regions they must
needs adopt native customs, so they bought
sledges and either dragged them themselves
or hired guides and teams of dogs. It is no
easy matter to drive one of these Esquimaux
sledges, for the dogs are harnessed in single file
and are only controlled by the voice of the driver
or by the long flexible whip which he carries. The
speed at which a sledge can be drawn depends very
much on the condition of the snow, but if it is
hard and smooth forty or fifty miles can be
covered in a single day.</p>

</div></div>

<p>After Sir John Franklin's expedition had disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
in the unknown Arctic world, many
parties set out in search of him. The leader of
one of these, Captain Austin, tried a new means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of progression, and on one occasion attached sails
and large kites to his sledges. This experiment
seems to have met with some success, but we do
not hear of it being attempted again, although
ice-boats are sailed as an amusement during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
winter months on the frozen lakes and rivers of
Canada and the United States. Snow-shoes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
widely used in Canada during the winter.
Hunters and trappers make long journeys over
the snow in search of fur or visiting their traps.</p>

<p>EXPLORERS DRAGGING SLEDGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of late years explorers have turned their attention
to the South Pole, and in Antarctic regions
not only dogs but small, hardy ponies have been
employed.</p>

<p>In Lapland, the most northern country of
Europe, the natives keep large herds of reindeer,
and they use these animals to draw their sledges,
which are shaped like boats, being flat at the back
and with high-pointed prows. The reindeer are
harnessed by leather traces fastened to their
collars, and the reins are tied to their horns. The
harness is hung with small bells which jingle
merrily as the sledge flies across the hard snow.
Old writers say that these animals were so swift
that they could carry their masters for two hundred
miles in a single day. This, of course, is
merely a traveller's tale, but they can really go
fifty or sixty miles in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Sledges are used in other European countries
and especially in Russia, where the winters are
long and hard. The Russian sledges are very
picturesque, with their four horses harnessed
abreast and their drivers wearing great padded
coats and fur gloves to protect them from the
intense cold. Sledging in Russia is, however, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
without its dangers, and there are many stories
of travellers who have been frozen to death, and
of others who have been overtaken and killed by
wolves as they drove across the snow-covered
plains and through the forests.</p>

<p>A writer of fifty years ago tells us of an exciting
experience which he and a fellow-traveller
had when journeying in the Volga district after a
heavy snowstorm.</p>

<p>It was early morning when they started, and
the road was a very lonely one. They had not
gone far when six large wolves were seen, and
although these animals were frightened away by
a handful of burning hay being flung among them&mdash;for
wolves cannot bear the sight of fire&mdash;they
soon returned. Others joined them, and before
long the sledge was tearing across the snow with
a whole pack in close pursuit. The horses were
terrified and the position seemed a hopeless one,
but fortunately the travellers were armed, and
when they had managed to shoot four of the
wolves the others dispersed.</p>

<p>Sledges are also used in Austria, Germany, and
Holland, and in many museums quaint old Dutch
sledges can be seen, shaped like armchairs and
richly gilded and painted.</p>

<p>These dainty sleds were pushed, not drawn, and
in them the fair-haired Dutch maidens of former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
days were taken for merry excursions by their
brothers and boy friends along the smooth highways
of the frozen canals.</p>

<p>ENGLISH SLEDGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In England the winters are very seldom cold
enough for sledging to be indulged in, but still it
is not entirely unknown. An English sledge is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
as a rule, more lightly built than those of other
countries and is higher from the ground. It is
drawn by one or more horses and the harness is
hung with little bells.</p>

We most of us think of Australia as a very
warm, almost a tropical land, and it is quite a surprise
to learn that even our cousins "Down
Under" can sometimes enjoy real winter sports.
Our illustration, however, shows us that this is
the case, for here we see a picture of a sledge at
Kosciusko, New South Wales, taken, perhaps, on
some cold June mid-winter day. Kosciusko is
situated in one of the mountainous districts of
Australia, and there ice and snow&mdash;as we see in
the picture&mdash;are by no means unknown. This
sledge is low on the ground with two seats, one
behind the other, and it is drawn by a pair of
sturdy ponies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
STRANGE TRAVEL IN STRANGE LANDS</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap1">W</span>e have been to many countries and have
seen many modes of travel, but there are
still places, scattered over the globe,
which have not been visited and yet which have
strange and interesting vehicles of their own.
Let us imagine, then, that we are taking a hurried
voyage round the world, stopping here and there
for a few moments to see those lands which we
have left out on our previous tours.</p>

<p>We will start from Plymouth, and sail southward
until we come to the beautiful Portuguese
island of Madeira, and here some very curious
conveyances are to be seen. These are the carros,
light carts made of basket-work, which, instead of
having wheels, are mounted on runners like sleds.</p>

<p>It seems very strange at first to think of sledges
in connection with a country which boasts a semitropical
climate, and where, except in the mountains,
ice and snow are unknown, but the quaint
carro is well-suited to its conditions and slides
smoothly over the steep, paved roads.</p>

<p>BULLOCK CARRO, MADEIRA.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Two kinds of these sleds are used in Madeira.
The bullock carros, which are comfortably provided
with springs, awnings, and curtains, and the
more simple carros da monte, that look like large
toboggans and run at a great speed down the hills.
Hammocks are also used in the island to carry
travellers into districts where rough and winding
paths make the carro impracticable, and bullock
carts are to be seen on the farms and vineyards.
Some of these carts are very picturesque, especially
those on which huge casks are carried.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In St. Michael's and the other islands of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Azores, there are very curious bullock carts made
of basket-work, with solid wheels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>CARRO DA MONTE, MADEIRA.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
From the Azores, or Westward Islands, we
journey on until we come to the West Indies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
where, in Jamaica, we find that large, four-wheeled
wagons are used in the sugar plantations.
These have high sides so that great quantities of
the canes can be carried, and are drawn by four
or six oxen.</p>

<div><a name="bullock_cart_azores" id="bullock_cart_azores"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>BULLOCK CART, AZORES.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Small donkeys with panniers also have their
share of work in Jamaica, but the negro inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
do much of their transport for themselves,
and on market days chattering crowds of women
may be seen making their way into the towns with
great baskets of fruit or heavy bundles tied up in
gay bandana handkerchiefs on their woolly heads.</p>

<p>After seeing the islands of the Atlantic Ocean
we skirt round Africa and come to Madagascar,
where we find litters in use which are much like
those we have already seen in many countries and
in many ages. A traveller who visited Madagascar
in 1861 describes a royal procession when the
queen rode in a palanquin that was richly gilt and
embroidered with gold and scarlet.</p>

<p>We now cross Asiatic Turkey and reach to
Persia, where, if we wish to see the country, we
must engage horses for ourselves and baggage-mules
to carry our goods and chattels. A traveller
who went from Trebizond to Erzeroum in 1862
made the journey in this fashion, and a very
romantic experience it must have been, for the
scenery traversed was hilly and picturesque, and
the climate left nothing to be desired. "Our
caravan passed cheerfully along," he says, "the
bells on our horses jangling merrily and the muleteers
singing their chanting songs and entertaining
each other with marvellous narratives. Much
in the same way as we were travelling then, the
old Crusaders rode to Palestine."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
At that time, more than fifty years ago, the
Bagdad railway had not been begun and riding
was the only means of getting about the country.
The same writer describes the gorgeously caparisoned
horses with purple silk bridle reins and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
silver harness, on which the high officials of Persia
rode through the streets of Teheran, and goes on
to say that the people might be called a nation of
horsemen, for even the royal despatches of the
Shah and the public documents were dated
"From the King's Stirrup."</p>

<p>Among other interesting sights to be seen in
the towns of Persia are the itinerant beggars
mounted on small humped bullocks, and the large
panniers slung on to the backs of mules in which
women travel.</p>

<p>These panniers, which are closely covered, look
as if they would be very airless and uncomfortable,
but in them long journeys are made, and
the mules thus loaded may be met in company
with bullock-carts and long lines of camels on the
great caravan road which leads from Persia into
the heart of Central Asia.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan women and children travel on
camels, wooden panniers being hung on either
side of the animal's hump, while between them is
a kind of platform sheltered by a little tent-like
awning.</p>

<p>On we go, through Thibet and over the Himalayas,
where we see shaggy yaks coming across
the steep passes with heavy loads on their backs,
and so reach India, the strange vehicles of which
have been already described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
There was, however, one province which was
omitted when we visited India before, and this is
Pondicherry, which belongs to France and is the
only district of the great peninsula not under
British dominion. In this place a very original
conveyance called the push-push is to be seen. It
is a light carriage with wheels, springs, and awning
complete, but instead of being drawn by a
horse it is, as its name implies, pushed from
behind by two stalwart natives.</p>

<p>PONDICHERRY PUSH-PUSH.</p>
</div></div>

<p>East of India, across the Bay of Bengal, is
Burmah, a country where, as in Japan, everything
seems to be picturesque and artistic. Here we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
see little gaily clad women driving in charming
two-wheeled carts which have gracefully curved
fronts like the bows of a boat. Over the heads of
the passengers is arranged an umbrella-shaped
awning, and the bullocks which draw these dainty
conveyances wear elaborately decorated harness
and have collars hung with tinkling bells.</p>

<p>From Burmah our journey takes us to Siam,
where elephants are used both for transport purposes
and to carry travellers into the mountains
and forests of the interior. The howdahs of these
elephants are very curious, having large hoods
which project both in front and at the back.</p>

<p>Leaving the continent of Asia we cross the sea
to the Dutch island of Java, where the women
ride in palanquins suspended from a long pole and
carried by two or four porters. Hammocks,
which are very much like the kagos of Japan, are
also used, and there are quaint ox-carts with little
pent roofs and rough wheels made out of solid
slabs of wood.</p>

<p>Not very far from Java are the Philippine
Islands, which now belong to America. Here
strange-looking animals called water-buffaloes, or
carabaos, are employed to draw clumsy wooden
carts. The carabao is guided by a cord attached
to a ring in his nose, the driver sitting either on
the shaft of the cart or on the animal's back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
TRAVEL OF YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t the present time, when England, and
indeed almost the whole of the civilised
world, is covered with a network of railways,
and the cuttings, the tunnels, and the high
embankments seem almost to be physical features
of the landscape that we see around us, it is difficult
to realise that a hundred years ago none of
these things were in existence. Our great-grandfathers
and great-grandmothers, as we have seen,
had to be content with very different modes of
travel, and would have been amazed if they had
been told that it would be possible before very
long to make the journey from London to York
in a few hours.</p>

<p>It is said that Lord Worcester in the reign of
Charles II. was one of the first scientists to experiment
with steam engines, and about a century
later James Watt improved and utilised this
invention. We have all heard of the little Scotch
boy who used to sit watching the steam coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
from the spout of a boiling kettle, who puzzled his
head over its power and who, when he grew up,
worked hard in order to earn money and be able
to carry out his experiments.</p>

<p>The first railway was opened in 1825, but
before that the steam engine invented by Watt
had been in use for some time in collieries. One
of these early engines, which was called "Puffing
Billy," can still be seen in a London museum.</p>

<p>The railway trains of ninety years ago, wonderful
as they were considered then, were very
different from those of to-day, for there were no
comfortable carriages with windows and cushioned
seats, and the passengers had to travel in open
wagons. There were no waiting rooms or platforms
either, and the speed was very moderate,
fifteen to twenty miles an hour being thought
marvellous and even dangerous.</p>

<p>This is what a writer says in the year 1837:</p>

<p>"The length of the Liverpool railway is thirty-one
miles, and the fact that passengers are regularly
conveyed that distance by locomotive engines in
one and a half to two hours produced an extraordinary
sensation."</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>EARLY ENGINE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As the years went on, railways and the trains
which ran on them improved very quickly and
stage coaches became hopelessly old-fashioned,
but for some time a railway journey was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of an adventure and many strange plans
were made in order to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>One of the most eccentric of these ideas was
that the last carriage or van on a train should have
a roof sloping backwards towards the ground and
fitted with railway lines, so that if the train to
which it was attached were overtaken by another,
there would be no collision, for the second engine
would run up the sloping roof and travel along
on the top of the slower train.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Nowadays, railway travelling has become much
safer and also more luxurious, and our trains, with
their sleeping berths and restaurant cars, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
have been considered marvels by the early passengers
who crowded contentedly into the jolting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
open trucks of 1839. One of the most interesting
of modern trains is to be seen on the Sudan
line. It is painted white for the sake of coolness
and has wooden venetian blinds instead of
windows.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>MOUNTAIN RAILWAY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At first it was considered impossible for railways
to be constructed except on level ground, but difficulties
were gradually overcome and for many
years there have been trains running up the Rigi
and other mountains. Now a line has been made
to the summit of the Jung Frau, which is over
thirteen thousand feet high, and by it tourists can
be taken far into the region of perpetual snow.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century a
new power began to be used, and we hear of locomotives
driven not by steam but by electricity.
Now, although steam has not been ousted from
the field, there are many electric trains, and in
almost every city of Europe electric trams run
through the streets and often far out into the
country beyond.</p>

<p>Another invention of the nineteenth century
which made, as time went on, a new means of
travel, was the bicycle, but although the first of
these machines appeared more than a hundred
years ago, they were very strange-looking contrivances
indeed, and were considered ridiculous
and useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">
<p>HIGH BICYCLE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
The first of all cycles&mdash;if it can be dignified by
such a name&mdash;made it dÃ©but in 1808 in Paris.
It was called a "hobby-horse" and consisted of
two wheels placed one behind the other, and connected
by a bar on which was a small saddle. The
rider kept his feet on the ground, and when he
came to a hill raised them and let the machine
carry him down. At corners, however, he had
to lift up the hobby-horse and turn it round.</p>

<p>The dandy-horse, which had a movable front
wheel, came next, and then there was a long succession
of strange inventions, many of which
hailed from America. One of these consisted of
a large rocking-horse mounted on two wheels, and
another had one very large wheel in which the
rider sat. Some of these machines were propelled
with the feet, others with the hands.
Croft's invention was punted along by two long
poles in the hands of the rider, and Mey's machine
had a large front wheel in which a dog ran round
like a squirrel in a cage.</p>

<p>While experiments were being made with
these extraordinary contrivances, more practical
bicycles were already in use. They were called
velocipedes, or bone-shakers, and very wonderful
they were thought to be, although to our modern
eyes the high bicycle of thirty years ago with its
large front wheel on which the rider was perched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and small back wheel, seems almost as curious as
the quaint hobby-horse of earlier times.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>EARLY CYCLE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The present form of bicycle was first made
towards the end of the last century, after the
invention of pneumatic tyres, but motor-cycles
are now beginning to take its place, and we are
all familiar with these wonderful little vehicles,
many of which have a side-car for an extra passenger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and are able to travel at the rate of thirty,
forty, or even fifty miles an hour.</p>

<p>EARLY MOTOR-CAR.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From cycles we go to motor-cars, and now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
when the roads are thronged with these swift conveyances
it is strange to think that for a long time
"horseless carriages" were considered an impossibility
and spoken of with jeering incredulity.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, however, a
Frenchman invented a steam carriage which could
travel at the rate of two miles an hour, and
during the next half-century other vehicles of the
sort were patented besides several very curious
mechanical carriages.</p>

<p>A picture and description of one of these
appears in a magazine of the time, and we see
that it was a large carriage with four wheels. One
man sits in front, holding what are apparently
quite useless reins, while a second man, standing
behind in a kind of box, works a machine with
his feet and so propels the heavy conveyance
along. Another and an even more extraordinary-looking
carriage was invented by a Mr. Boller in
1804. It was propelled by a very complicated
arrangement of large and small cog-wheels.</p>

<p>Progress was made during the next few years,
and in 1829 two inventors had constructed a steam
carriage which could travel at the rate of fifteen
miles an hour. A little later we learn that there
was a regular service of steam coaches running
between Gloucester and Cheltenham.</p>

<p>After that, however, many years elapsed before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
horseless carriages came into general use, one
reason being that such conveyances were heavily
taxed and subjected to many rules. It was not
until 1896 that these were altered, and then immediately
there was a change and cars driven by
steam, electricity, and petrol came into use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
THE TRAVEL OF TO-MORROW</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he travel of to-morrow! It is a fascinating
subject, for, as we look backward
through the last century and see the marvellous
progress that has been made, it is impossible
to believe that now we have come to a standstill.
How then shall we travel in the future?
Will it be in some new form of railway train or
motor-car, with increased speed and added comfort?
Or shall we leave solid earth behind us
altogether and make our journeys in great airships
and aeroplanes?</p>

<p>We will begin with the more commonplace
methods, and consider the possibilities of improvements
and innovations in railway travel.</p>

<p>Lately a great deal has been said and written
about the mono-rail, and it seems quite likely that
alterations will take place in this direction, for a
single-line railway is comparatively cheap to construct,
and has many other advantages, among
them that of greatly increased speed. It is estimated
that this could easily reach two miles a
minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
In Africa we saw a very primitive form of
mono-railway, and there is another in Algeria,
where the trucks or baskets filled with agricultural
produce hang on either side of a single line
and are drawn along by mules.</p>

<p>A real mono-railway with engines, railway carriages,
and trucks is already in existence in Ireland,
where it runs between Listowel and Ballybunion.
The line is raised some feet from the
ground, and is about 10 miles in length. The
engine is a very curious-looking machine, with a
boiler on each side and two funnels. This is
arranged so that the weight is evenly balanced.
There are also methods by which the trains on a
mono-railway may be steadied by means of a wonderful
contrivance called a gyroscope.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the single-line railway is the
hanging railway, which was first invented to carry
loads of merchandise or minerals across rivers or
over rough forest lands where an ordinary line
would be difficult and expensive to construct.
There is one of these hanging railways in
Rhodesia, where a strong wire crosses from bank
to bank of a river, and carries a chair-shaped seat
which can hold two passengers. This is dragged
backwards and forwards by means of a second
wire.</p>

<div><a name="mono_rail_car_with_gyroscope" id="mono_rail_car_with_gyroscope"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>MONO-RAIL CAR, WITH GYROSCOPE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes, instead of wire, rope is used, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
these rope railways can be seen in use at many
of the mines in South Africa.</p>

<p>Other and more elaborate railways in the air
have been made in Germany, and there is one for
passengers running between Barmen and Elberfield.
In this case the single rail is raised on high
trestles, and the carriage, which looks very much
like a large tramcar, runs along the line suspended
beneath the trestles.</p>

<p>Then, too, we may in the future have railways
that will take us across the English Channel,
either through a great tunnel or over a bridge,
reaching, as was proposed in 1884, from Folkestone
to Cape Grisnez.</p>

<p>A third plan that has been suggested for crossing
to France is that of a submarine bridge, upon
which a curious construction or platform would
run, and on this the trains themselves could be
taken from shore to shore, while still another
proposal was that large ferry-steamers should be
built, on the lower decks of which the trains could
be carried.</p>

<p>And now we will leave the earth and look at
the pictures of airships and the wonderful aeroplanes,
which, although improvements are being
made every day, can already travel at an almost
incredible speed and with a security that only a
little while ago would have been considered quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
impossible. Nowadays air travel is not only a
possibility but an accomplished fact, and it is hard
to realise that it has come about during the last
twenty years, and that before then practical flying
machines were unknown.</p>

<p>OVERHEAD TROLLEY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From very early times, however, inventors and
scientists have dreamed and experimented, and
no less than seven hundred years ago, Roger
Bacon, one of the most learned men of his day,
seems to have looked down through the centuries
and to have actually seen the aeroplanes with
which we are now familiar.</p>

<p>"There may be made a flying instrument," he
says, "so that a man sitting in the midst of the
instrument and turning some mechanism may
move some artificial wings so that they may beat
the air like a bird in flight."</p>

<p>It was a strange prophecy, but in those far-off
times&mdash;the dark ages we call them&mdash;men had
already fixed their hopes on flight, and school children
were trained in the use of wings as in that
of the globes.</p>

<p>We are not told what advantages this curious
accomplishment gave to the little boys and girls
of the thirteenth century, and, indeed, it may
have brought them ill-fortune, for in those days
inventors were often accused of witchcraft, and
new ideas were looked upon with suspicion. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
centuries later, when the first balloons were causing
great excitement in England, many people
thought that it was wrong to spurn the laws of
nature by attempting to fly.</p>

<p>MONOPLANE, THE FIRST TYPE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
some very strange flying machines were
made, and even before that time, in the reign of
James IV. of Scotland, we find that "The Abbot
of Tungland tuik in hand to flie with wingis."
The bold Churchman, however, did not succeed in
his rash venture, but fell from the wall of Stirling
Castle and broke his thigh.</p>

<p>In 1709 another monk planned a wonderful flying
ship which was to carry twelve men besides
stores of food, and about sixty years later a
Frenchman made himself "A whirl of feathers,
curiously interlaced and extending gradually at
suitable distances in a horizontal direction from
his head to his feet." In this eccentric costume
the would-be bird-man fluttered down from a
height of seventy feet and escaped uninjured.</p>

<p>The makers of balloons, meanwhile, met with
more success, and they bravely experimented with
their frail contrivances, which at first were filled
with heated air and necessitated a fire in the
basket-work car, fed with fuel of chopped straw.
As may be imagined, many accidents occurred,
but the inventors went on their way undaunted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
and in the middle of the nineteenth century we
find a man named Nadar constructing an enormous
balloon called the "Giant," which seems to
have been the forerunner of the great airships of
to-day. This monster would, we hear, have
exactly fitted into the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral.
It had a smaller balloon attached to it, and
below both a car fitted with wheels. This was
divided into compartments for the captain and
the passengers, with beds, baggage, and provisions,
while a printing office and a photographer's
room were included.</p>

<p>Nadar's ambitions, however, did not stop at this
marvel. Indeed, the "Giant" was only intended
to be a means of raising funds for the making of a
flying machine, which was to be called the aeronef
and have wings and a screw propeller.</p>

<p>The difficulty then, and for many years afterwards,
was to make an engine which at the same
time should be sufficiently strong and yet light.
It was not until another fifty years had passed
that this problem was solved and then we find
the modern aeroplanes and hydroplanes being
gradually developed and improved.</p>

<p>In 1909 a French aviator crossed the Channel
for the first time, and since then the progress has
been extraordinary, so that now we think little
of feats which a dozen years ago would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
been considered quite outside the bounds of
possibility.</p>

<p>Side by side with the aeroplanes, dirigible balloons
have been developed, and we can hardly
doubt that in the future this mode of travel will
come to be as safe and almost as commonplace as
our railways and motor-cars of to-day.</p>
